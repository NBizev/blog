## Overview

1. last week I worked 4 shifts and did 2 laboratory works but I did them late and because of this I did not receive a grade

2. I also missed a lot of classes, but not because of laziness but because I was sick

3. Since last week I have been reading textbooks on my subjects

4. Itâ€™s still hard both at school and at work, but I can handle it
