## Overview

1. LaTeX is a computer layout system developed by American computer science professor Donald Knuth, author of the programmers' bible The Art of Computer Programming. It is a set of macro extensions to a computer layout system that makes it easier to create complex documents. Today, LaTeX includes many different add-on packages for working with data in different formats: formulas, graphs, footnotes, notes, and others.

3. Git is one of the most widely used version control systems in the world, and its usage statistics reflect this. Here are some Git usage statistics:
Organizations around the world use Git for version control.

4. Working with LaTeX comes down to writing code, which has a few basic components and fragments. At the same time, you need to know a few nuances:

· In-text formulas are surrounded on both sides by $ signs.

· Off formulas (placed on a separate line) are surrounded by $ signs or a pair of commands \[ and \]. Formulas enclosed in $ are always centered horizontally.

· Intratext formulas, with the exception of the shortest ones, are typed on a separate line.

· To align the document, use the following tags: \flushleft - to the left, \flushrigth - to the right, \center - to the center.

· The default verbatim environment helps to display even complex code correctly.

5. Most mathematical functions and symbols, as well as parentheses, matrices, and systems of equations in LaTeX syntax are indicated by tags beginning with the \ character.

· To work with expressions that span more than one line (that is, for neat text wrapping or calculations), you can use the \\ delimiter.

· Greek and lemniscate letters, the infinity symbol and others are entered as tags.

After learning the basics and basic tags of the language, entering and subsequently editing formulas becomes a simple and understandable process, and Sergei Lvovsky’s textbook will help in learning the simple syntax of LaTex. The book is free and available here.
