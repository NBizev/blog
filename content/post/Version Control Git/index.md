## Overview

1. Git is a Version Control System (VCS) with distributed repository state control. This means that each developer has a complete copy of the repository (the directory containing all the project files and the history of changes to these files) on his local computer. This allows the development team to work on the project code simultaneously and without conflicts.


2. Despite the fact that proprietary software still occupies a large share of the software market in educational and corporate software, organizations are increasingly opting for open source developments, which captivate them with flexibility and cost savings.

3. Git is one of the most widely used version control systems in the world, and its usage statistics reflect this. Here are some Git usage statistics:
